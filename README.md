In order to increase capabilities for managers to incorporate bonuses, this project entails developing a JavaScript software to monitor staff wages. We illustrate fundamental object-oriented programming concepts by creating an Employee class that has attributes for name and salary in addition to a method for figuring out the annual compensation. Inheritance and polymorphism are demonstrated via a Manager subclass that inherits from Employee and adds a department property in addition to altering the annual wage computation to include a 15% bonus. To verify the implementation, we create two Manager objects and report their salary and bonuses using test data. This project offers hands-on practice in OOP, pay management, and bonus computations in an actual work environment.
